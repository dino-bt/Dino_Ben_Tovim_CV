    <p>
        Hello my name my real name is Daniel but everyone calls me Dino. I was born in Israel and grew up in South
        Africa. I moved back to Israel at the age of 17 were I matriculated. I moved back five years ago to finish my
        Bachelor of Arts in Music Production and Sound engineering. Music has been a big part of life. I have been in
        the events industry and Djâ€™ing for most of my professional life. I produce mainly electronic music. I have
        organized small events as well. In the last couple of months I have been interested in programing. I started to
        learn Python and built my first web app using Django. I then decided that Web Development is the path that I
        would like to pursue and enrolled in the Hyperion Dev 3 month bootcamp. I believe that in life we need balance I
        have not given up my passion for music but added a new passion to the list I believe that we should not limit
        ourselves into believing that we can only be focused on one path the mind is capable of doing extraordinary
        things, if we are willing to take the leap.
